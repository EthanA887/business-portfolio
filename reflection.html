                    <h2>Reflections</h2>
                    <dl>
                        <dt><i>What assignment or task did you like the MOST in this course? Why?</i></dt>
                        <dd>
                            <p>Out of all the assignments in the past semester, I enjoyed my Interview with an Entrepreneur the most. This project allowed me to step far outside of my comfort zone and find an example of how the course’s concepts apply to real life. In several other courses we are taught theoretical ideas without their practical applications being clear, but by taking part in this interview, I gained valuable insight into the mindset of a real entrepreneur. As a result, I learned lessons that apply to not just business, but life in general, such as the principles of taking risks and incremental growth. Additionally, I was initially hesitant to speak to an adult about his business, but the project put me in a situation where I had no choice but to instantly build confidence and take action. This developed my communication and initiative. Overall, I was inspired by the conversation I had and eager to relay it to the class.</p>
                        </dd>
                        <dt><i>Name 3 entrepreneurial skills that you learned in this course. Explain each.</i></dt>
                        <dd>
                            <p>The first entrepreneurial skill I learned was decision-making. Through activities such as the stuffie shelter for project management and the Froot Loops challenge for the production process, I was required to come up with solutions to seemingly simple but very open-ended problems with time constraints. Within my groups, I had to participate in decision-making to determine the direction that our final product was heading toward. In addition, I developed my communication skills through the semester to become a more skilled speaker. By delivering presentations such as the Interview with an Entrepreneur, Venture Pitch, and the How it’s Made assignment, I added confidence, persuasion, proper body language, and improvisation skills to my toolbox. Furthermore, I advanced my leadership capabilities during my venture. By taking charge of our production process and assigning duties, I was able to effectively implement the democratic leadership style and ensure that our group was set up for success. </p>
                        </dd>
                        <dt><i>How will the entrepreneurial skills you learned in this course help you in the future?</i></dt>
                        <dd>
                            <p>The three entrepreneurial skills that I focused on were decision-making, communication, and leadership, and in the world of entrepreneurship and intrapreneurship, they all have practical applications. Decision making is an integral part of business leadership since it directly determines the future of the company, and after this course, I am slightly better positioned to participate in it and consider the impacts of my choices. Communication is essential in entrepreneurship; not only to customers and investors, but within the company as well, to ensure alignment on goals and improved collaboration. Finally, leadership is practical because leaders set the direction and vision of the company, motivate those who work with them, and navigate in times of uncertainty. Even if I don’t end up as an entrepreneur or intrapreneur, these are essential life skills that will improve my ability to interact with others.</p>
                        </dd>
                        <dt><i>What is one Job or Career that you think will use the skills and abilities taught in this course? Why?</i></dt>
                        <dd>
                            <p>One specific position that the skills in this course apply to is a Chief Financial Officer or CFO. As the company’s top financial authority, the CFO is responsible for analyzing internal data, such as cash flow, assets, and liabilities, as well as external factors, to propose strategic direction. CFOs must be expert decision-makers because the company’s future lies in their hands: they are responsible for budgeting, capital structuring, risk management, mergers and acquisitions, and much more. Communication is also important for this role because they have to report to the board of directors and investors, and transparency is a crucial component of finance. Leadership is also a significant skill since it is an executive role and there are several managers and employees under your control. Some other skills taught in this course are basic economics and finance, which are fundamentals, but I think this course improved my time management and research abilities. These are also essential to fulfilling the duties of a corporate leadership position.</p>

                        <dt><i>One thing about entrepreneurship that I am still trying to learn is…? Explain.</i></dt>
                        <dd>
                            <p>Entrepreneurship is a vast field with many interesting aspects, and one part of it that I want to explore on my own is risk management. Specifically, I am trying to learn how businesses assess their tolerance for risk by identifying, assessing, and treating threats. There are many different types of risk in business, and being familiar with them is a significant advantage before becoming an intrapreneur or entrepreneur because you can gain an understanding of the company’s strengths and weaknesses. I will pursue knowledge in the field of risk management by incorporating it into my DECA study - in preparation for competitions next year, I will focus on roleplays related to financial and non-financial (operational, strategic, legal, etc.) risk.</p>
                        </dd>
                        <dt><i>What do you wish we did differently in this course? Why?</i></dt>
                        <dd>
                            <p>The course content itself has been thorough and very relevant in my opinion, but there is another way it could have been organized. The functions of business themselves could have been separated into units, where we do a deep dive into finance, marketing, production, human resources, and sales. This would allow us to have a complete background of each field (for example, knowing more about accounting within finance or psychology within marketing) and create more course to course connections. I understand that the course is focused on entrepreneurship, so an emphasis needs to be placed on the venture and the characteristics of entrepreneurs themselves, but I think these units resulted in long projects that coincided with the summatives of other courses.</p>
                        </dd>
                        <dt><i>How are the skills you are developing in school preparing you for future careers? </i></dt>
                        <dd>
                            <p>I believe that subjects in elementary and middle school exist purely for educational purposes, to actually teach the basics of math, science, English, and other areas. However, in high school, I think that the courses exist to teach us how to learn - which involves study skills, making connections, time management, and soft skills to prepare us for university or eventually, the workforce. One way this happens is how we learn to manage our workload of assignments - which translate to managing tasks in the workplace or more assignments in post-secondary education. In terms of soft skills, we have developed problem solving and communication skills, among others. Problem solving leads to increased adaptability, which is suitable for business leadership, as well as efficiency, which is useful in engineering-based careers. Communication prepares students for future careers by improving their collaboration skills, which are useful in every field, and enabling them to be adept speakers, a practical trait for sales or marketing.</p>
