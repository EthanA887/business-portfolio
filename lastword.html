					<p>I found these statements to be crucial guidelines for life, especially because I place a significant focus on consistency. If you recall my presentation for the Interview with an Entrepreneur assignment, the major lesson I took away was the importance of incremental growth, which means to improve consistently, one step at a time. However, this applies not just to your business, but to your life—once you set a goal and work towards it, focusing on consistent progress as opposed to overnight success, the change over time will be absolutely transformational. For example, if you get one percent better at something each day for one year, you will end up 38 times better than you were when you started (1.01<sup>365</sup> = 37.78).<br><br></p>
					<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/tiny-gains-graph.jpg" style="width: 50%;"></div><br><br><p>This is the power of consistency: seemingly insignificant improvements adding up to true achievement. When this quote names the killers of consistency: laziness, comfort, doubts, and fear, it shows you how your mind gets in the way of this achievement. The human mind tends toward these because it wants to avoid discomfort and seek rewards, which is why such a small number of people can achieve complete success. However, once we read the first four lines backwards, we get the solution to this problem. By being committed to your improvement, you can get rid of negative emotions and unwanted tendencies, and eventually, build habits that will set you up for success.<br><br>
					I chose this graphic because of its simplicity and the clever message from reading it backwards—I think this advice is fairly straightforward to follow. One area in which this advice could help me is running: I took Personal Fitness last semester and developed an interest in middle- and long-distance running but recently, I have struggled to find the time to keep fit. Currently, I care more about building my endurance than becoming the fastest runner, so I am seeking consistency to build the habit of running more, and eventually reap the benefits of improvement.</p>
