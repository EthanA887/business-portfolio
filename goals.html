						<h2>Logo &amp; Rationale</h2>
						<p style="line-height: 2; font-size: 16px;"><img src="images/personal logo.jpg" style="width: 20%; float: left; margin-right: 50px;">My mission is related to my ultimate goals in life and the world I want to create for myself. The experiences in this course and DECA Finance have taught me that the entire world relies on money, but time is ultimately far more important. As a result, my objective is to be able to have autonomy over my time, as opposed to having someone control it for me. This would mean eventually relying on passive income as an entrepreneur or investor instead of staying in a 9-5 job until I retire, in order to prioritize my family and pursue my passions in my spare time. On the other hand, my vision is particularly career-focused and reflects my aspirations in relation to computer science. Since this is a rapidly changing field, I see the potential to contribute to new developments, specifically in machine learning. I want to leave a legacy behind, which is the significance of the rock in my logo. Part of my vision is to have a lasting impact in my career, which is represented by how my initials are carved onto the rock. Finally, the values I chose relate to my purpose because fulfillment can only be achieved through perseverance and mastery, and integrity is essential for anyone who wants to inspire others.</p>

						<h2>SMART Goal #1</h2>
						<img src="images/cybersecurity.jpg" style="float: right; width: 30%; margin-right: 50px;">
						<table style="width: 65%; line-height: 1.5;">
							<tbody>
								<tr>
									<td><b>Short-term Goal</b></td>
									<td>By September 1st, 2025, I will complete the Google Cybersecurity Certificate in order to gain practical experience with cybersecurity.</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td><b>Specific</b></td>
									<td>I will complete all courses and modules involved in the certificate over the summer. This will be one of my main responsibilities for those two months and I am working toward this goal for two main reasons: to know more about the applications of Python and SQL and to add to my list of accomplishments.</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td><b>Measurable</b></td>
									<td>I can measure my progress through the online course's dashboard, which displays the percentage of each course finished. I will also set up a schedule proportional to how much time I have and how many tasks there are to complete.</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td><b>Achievable</b></td>
									<td>This certificate is offered to grade 10 and 11 students, so it should be within my skill level. In addition, I have some prior programming experience so the technical aspects should be familiar.</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td><b>Relevant</b></td>
									<td>My goal is highly relevant to the rest of my purpose (specifically with regard to my vision about a career in computer science) and it will help me to develop the habit of consistency, the importance of which will be discussed in The Last Word.</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td><b>Time-bound</b></td>
									<td>The deadline is set to September 1st, 2025, which is realistic in my opinion because I plan to dedicate approximately 20 hours per week to the course.</td>
								</tr>
							</tbody>
						</table>
						<h2>SMART Goal #2</h2>
						<img src="images/home-ownership.jpg" style="float: right; width: 30%; margin-right: 50px;">
						<table style="width: 65%; line-height: 1.5;">
							<tbody>
								<tr>
									<td><b>Long-term Goal</b></td>
									<td>I plan to own at least one house within the next 20 years through a careful strategy that balances saving and investing.</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td><b>Specific</b></td>
									<td>The objective is to own a detached house, ideally in the GTA, and this is a long-term endeavor. I want to accomplish this because owning a home will serve as a sound metric of financial stability.</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td><b>Measurable</b></td>
									<td>I will measure my progress by analyzing my income and expenses and keeping track of the amount I have saved, making adjustments to my budget monthly.</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td><b>Achievable</b></td>
									<td>By entering a high-paying career path and earning passive income, I think this is an achievable goal despite the pessimism and uncertainty around home ownership for Gen Z.</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td><b>Relevant</b></td>
									<td>This goal is extremely relevant to my mission of financial independence and it can serve as an indicator of overall success.</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td><b>Time-bound</b></td>
									<td>The deadline is 20 years from now, or the year 2045â€”at that time I will be 36 years old. As a result, this plan will involve almost two decades of financial planning, which is significantly more than the standard time required for home ownership by previous generations.</td>
								</tr>
